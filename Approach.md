# Step-by-Step Approach for AI-Powered Medical Claims Analytics Bot

## 1. Setup & Environment Configuration

- Prepare your Python 3.10+ environment with a virtual environment.
- Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Configure environment variables securely via `.env` for Oracle DB and Gemini API keys.

## 2. Oracle Database Connection Pooling

- Establish a pooled, async connection to your Oracle database using `python-oracledb`.
- Initialize and gracefully close the pool within your FastAPI app lifecycle.
- Use a read-only Oracle user with only SELECT permissions to guarantee data safety.

## 3. Schema Extraction and Smart Caching

- Query Oracle metadata tables to extract schema: tables, columns, data types.
- Cache this schema in memory or Redis to avoid repeated expensive queries.
- Implement semantic indexing with embeddings (e.g., via LangChain) to retrieve relevant tables dynamically based on user queries.

## 4. Gemini API Integration for NL-to-SQL

- Wrap the Gemini API using the official `google-generativeai` client.
- Develop prompt engineering logic to supply Gemini with:
  - System instructions (generate safe, read-only Oracle SQL only),
  - Dynamic relevant schema context,
  - Few-shot examples relevant to your domain.
- Apply temperature and max tokens settings to ensure consistent, concise SQL generation.
- Implement retry and correction logic to handle errors from Gemini output.

## 5. SQL Validation & Execution Workflow

- Before execution, validate generated SQL syntax and enforce strict safety policies:
  - Must start with SELECT,
  - No INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc.
- Execute validated SQL queries using the pooled Oracle connection.
- Safely fetch results and handle timeouts or errors gracefully with appropriate logging.

## 6. Report Generation in PDF

- Convert query results into professionally formatted PDF reports using ReportLab.
- Include sections like report title, generation timestamp, original natural language question, executed SQL query, query results (tables/charts), and audit information.
- Add confidentiality and compliance footers suitable for government use.

## 7. Audit Logging & Security

- Log every query submission with metadata: user ID, timestamp, raw question, generated SQL, result count, execution time, and retry attempts.
- Store audit logs securely in a write-once, immutable store with a retention period (e.g., 7 years).
- Enforce API key authentication and role-based permissions at the API gateway or FastAPI middleware.
- Ensure all communications are encrypted (TLS/HTTPS).

## 8. API Endpoints & Interfaces

- Develop RESTful API endpoints in FastAPI:
  - `/api/v1/query` (POST) to accept questions and return SQL results plus PDF report URL.
  - `/api/v1/schema` (GET) for debugging and schema inspection.
  - `/health` (GET) for system readiness checks.
- Integrate OpenAPI/Swagger docs for easy testing and client generation.

## 9. Testing & Validation

- Write unit tests for each module: database connections, Gemini client, SQL validator, PDF generator.
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
- Maintain a test suite of known natural language queries with expected SQL and results for benchmarking.
- Monitor accuracy, error rates, and latency during development and pilot.

## 10. Deployment, Monitoring & Scaling

- Deploy on a production-grade server/environment with process management (e.g., systemd), reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), and SSL.
- Implement monitoring dashboards for API health, query throughput, Gemini API usage, and error alerts.
- Use caching layers (Redis) for common query results and schema data.
- Plan scaling by increasing pool sizes, adding worker instances, and upgrading Gemini API tier if needed.

---

This approach prioritizes:

- **Accuracy** through careful prompt engineering and validation,
- **Security** via strict read-only enforcement and audit trails,
- **Scalability** by async FastAPI design, connection pooling, caching,
- **Compliance** by logging and PDF reports tailored for government standards.

You can begin by setting up your environment and Oracle connection module, then progressively implement AI integration, query validation, report generation, testing, and deployment following these steps.
