# Step-by-Step Approach for AI-Powered Medical Claims Analytics Bot (With LLM-Enhanced Report Generation)

## 1. Setup & Environment Configuration

- Prepare your Python 3.10+ environment with a virtual environment.
- Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Configure environment variables securely via `.env` for Oracle DB and Gemini API keys.

## 2. Oracle Database Connection Pooling

- Establish a pooled, async connection to your Oracle database using `python-oracledb`.
- Initialize and gracefully close the pool within your FastAPI app lifecycle.
- Use a read-only Oracle user with only SELECT permissions to guarantee data safety.

## 3. Schema Extraction and Smart Caching

- Query Oracle metadata tables to extract schema: tables, columns, data types.
- Cache this schema in memory or Redis to avoid repeated expensive queries.
- Implement semantic indexing with embeddings (e.g., via LangChain) to retrieve relevant tables dynamically based on user queries.

## 4. Gemini API Integration for NL-to-SQL

- Wrap the Gemini API using the official `google-generativeai` client.
- Develop prompt engineering logic to supply Gemini with:
  - System instructions (generate safe, read-only Oracle SQL only),
  - Dynamic relevant schema context,
  - Few-shot examples relevant to your domain.
- Apply temperature and max tokens settings to ensure consistent, concise SQL generation.
- Implement retry and correction logic to handle errors from Gemini output.

## 5. SQL Validation & Execution Workflow

- Before execution, validate generated SQL syntax and enforce strict safety policies:
  - Must start with SELECT,
  - No INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc.
- Execute validated SQL queries using the pooled Oracle connection.
- Safely fetch results and handle timeouts or errors gracefully with appropriate logging.

## 6. LLM-Powered Insight & Report Generation

- After fetching query results, send either full data (if small) or aggregated/sampled statistics to the LLM (Gemini).
- Use prompt engineering to request:
  - Executive summaries,
  - Key metrics and trends,
  - Anomalies or highlights,
  - Recommendations based on data.
- Integrate the generated narrative as an **Insights** or **Executive Summary** section in the report.

## 7. PDF Report Generation with ReportLab

- Use **ReportLab** to programmatically build the PDF report including:
  - Title, generation timestamp,
  - Original natural language question and actual SQL query executed,
  - The raw data in tables and optionally charts,
  - The LLM-generated insights/narrative section,
  - Compliance footers and audit trail information.
- This ensures consistent, compliant, professional output suitable for government audits.

## 8. Audit Logging & Security

- Log every query submission along with metadata: user ID, timestamp, raw question, generated SQL, result count, execution time, retries.
- Store audit logs in immutable storage with defined retention (e.g., 7 years).
- Enforce API key authentication and role-based access control.
- Use TLS/HTTPS for all communication.

## 9. API Endpoints & Interfaces

- Develop RESTful API endpoints to:
  - Accept natural language queries and return results + PDFs,
  - Provide schema metadata for debugging,
  - Health checks.
- Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger.

## 10. Testing & Validation

- Unit tests for individual modules.
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows including LLM insight generation.
- Maintain query and result accuracy benchmarks.

## 11. Deployment, Monitoring & Scaling

- Deploy on production-grade infrastructure with SSL termination and proper process management.
- Monitor API health, execution latency, Gemini API usage.
- Apply caching for expensive queries and schema metadata.
- Plan for scaling backend and LLM tiers as usage grows.

---

This hybrid approach leverages the **LLM's natural language strengths** for generating insightful, human-readable analysis, while relying on **ReportLab's programmatic PDF creation** capabilities for precise report formatting and compliance needs.

The result is comprehensive PDF reports that combine raw data, rigorous audit information, and executive data narratives, ideal for decision makers handling complex medical claims data.
